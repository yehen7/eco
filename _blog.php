            <p class="card-text">Most people would agree that recycling is one “simple” activity that allows them to do their part in bettering the environment. And, while most individuals have good intentions when recycling, 62 percent of Americans worry that a lack of knowledge is causing them to do so incorrectly. According to the findings, these concerns stem from an absence of recycling information and a general misunderstanding of what can and cannot be recycled. Luckily, with better information at our fingertips, we can all do our part in protecting the environment by educating ourselves, our customers, and our colleagues about the significance of effective and sustainable waste management practices as well as proper recycling techniques.</p>
